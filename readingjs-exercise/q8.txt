Question How can we update Bruce Wayne's second favorite color to pink?

var Bruce = { favorite_food: "Hot dog",
              favorite_color: ["Blue", "Red", "Black"],
              favorite_car: "BMW X6",
              };

Answer
Replacing "Red" to "Pink" to "favorite_color" by following code,

Bruce["favorite_color"][1] = "Pink";
